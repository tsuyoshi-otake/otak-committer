## Security & Privacy

We take your security and privacy seriously. This extension is built with the highest standards of data protection:

### API Key Protection
- **Secure Storage**: All API keys are stored using VS Code's SecretStorage API, never in plain text
- **Encrypted Backups**: Redundant storage uses AES-256-GCM encryption with machine-specific keys
- **Automatic Migration**: Legacy API keys in settings are automatically moved to secure storage and deleted
- **No Configuration Files**: API keys never appear in `settings.json` or any configuration files that could be accidentally committed

### Data Handling
- **Local Processing**: Git diff analysis happens locally on your machine
- **Minimal Data Transfer**: Only necessary diff information is sent to OpenAI for commit message generation
- **No Data Retention**: We don't store or log your code, commits, or any repository information
- **Direct API Communication**: All requests go directly to OpenAI's API - no intermediate servers
- **Token Limits**: Large diffs are automatically truncated to prevent accidental exposure of extensive codebases

### Privacy Guarantees
- **No Telemetry**: This extension collects no usage data, analytics, or telemetry
- **No Third-Party Services**: Apart from OpenAI for generation and GitHub for PR/issue creation, no other external services are used
- **Open Source**: Full source code is available for security audits on [GitHub](https://github.com/tsuyoshi-otake/otak-committer)
- **Isolated Scope**: The extension only accesses staged Git changes and selected files when explicitly requested

### Secure Development
- **Single Maintainer**: Maintained by a single, accountable developer to prevent unauthorized code injection
- **Direct Control**: All code changes are personally reviewed and tested before release
- **No External Contributors**: Eliminates risks associated with malicious pull requests or compromised contributor accounts
- **Transparent Updates**: Every update is documented in the changelog with clear descriptions of changes
- **Consistent Security Standards**: Uniform security practices across all code, ensuring no weak points from varying coding standards

### GitHub Integration
- **Minimal Permissions**: Only requests the `repo` scope for PR and issue operations
- **Token Security**: GitHub tokens are stored in the same secure storage as API keys
- **Official API**: Uses GitHub's official REST API with standard authentication

### Best Practices
- We recommend using dedicated API keys for this extension
- Regularly rotate your API keys for additional security
- Review generated content before committing or submitting PRs
- Use the diagnostic tools to verify secure storage is working correctly

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code 1.90.0 or higher
- Git
- OpenAI API key (for AI features)

### Setting Up Your OpenAI API Key

1. Get your API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. In VS Code, run the command: `otak-committer: Set OpenAI API Key`
3. Enter your API key when prompted

The extension uses GPT-4o for optimal results. Your API key is stored securely using VS Code's secret storage.

### Setting Up GitHub Access

For PR and issue features:

1. Create a [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Select the `repo` scope
3. Copy the token
4. Add it to VS Code settings: `otakCommitter.github.token`

The `repo` scope enables:
- Creating pull requests
- Linking issues
- Applying labels and milestones
